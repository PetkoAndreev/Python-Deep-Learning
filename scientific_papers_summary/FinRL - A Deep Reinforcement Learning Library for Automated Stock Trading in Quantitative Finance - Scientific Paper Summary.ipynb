    "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n",
    "<h5>Target - quantitative finance</h5>\n",
    "<p>In quantitative finance, stock trading is essentially making dynamic decisions, namely to decide where to trade, at what price, and what quantity, over a highly stochastic and complex stock market. As a result, DRL provides useful toolk-\n",
    "its for stock trading, because it balances exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge).</p>\n",
    "<h5>What and why is solved?</h5>\n",
    "<p>Taking many complex financial factors into account, DRL trading agents build a multi-factor model and provide algorithmic trading strategies, which are difficult for human traders. Here is the provided solution - a beginner-friendly library (FinRL) with fine-tuned standard DRL algorithms. It has been developed under three primary principles:\n",
    "    <ul>\n",

    "    </ul>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<h5>Definitions, names, models, approaches, etc.</h5>\n",
    "<p>Used models are several variants of DRL algorithms. DRL has been implemented on sentimental analysis on portfolio allocation and liquidation strategy analysis, showing the potential of DRL on various financial tasks. However, to implement a DRL or RL driven trading strategy is nowhere near as easy. The development and debugging processes are arduous and error-prone. \n",
    "The proposed three layered FinRL Library streamlines the development stock trading strategies. \n",
